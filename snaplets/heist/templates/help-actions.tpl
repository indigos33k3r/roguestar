<h1>Actions</h1>

<h3>Health</h3>

<p>This is how much life you have remaining.  An enemy attack can cost several points of health.</p>

<h3>Compass</h3>

<p>Indicates the direction to your goal.</p>

<h3>Movement Mode</h3>

<p>You can use normal movement or teleportation.</p>

<p>Normal movement will take an appropriate action depending on what tile you move into.
For example, if you move into a forest or mountain tile, this will clear a path.
Or, if you move into an enemy, you will attack it.</p>

<p>Teleportation will cause you to jump roughly 5-7 tiles, with a random landing point.
There is a small chance you will fail to teleport at all.
It is a good way to travel rapidly or escape enemies.</p>
