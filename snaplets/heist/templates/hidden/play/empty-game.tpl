<h6 class="quest">A Recreant's Dream</h6>

<p>Thousands of years ago, on a distant planet, an alien civilization waged war.  
They destroyed themselves, but their machines continue to fight over the charred landscape of their homeworld.<p>

<p>Long after the heroes and causes of this conflict have been forgotten, you roll off an underground assembly line.  
Unlike your autonomous brothers, you desire more than a life of endless battle against foes whose only crime is being
programmed with a different IFF transponder code.
Your sensors tell you that there is a portal, somewhere on the planet's surface, that will take you away from this world . . .</p>
