<p>Roguestar would look a LOT better with artwork.  Any kind of hand-drawing, painting, digital or 3D artwork can be used, if it is stylistically sensible and you have the right to contribute it.  In particular, I need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Logos, headers, footers, any kind of sensible decoration for the web site.</li>
<li>Pictures of monsters, characters and equipment (not humans).</li>
<li>Pictures of landscapes and environments.</li>
<li>Pictures of creatures performing specific tasks, such as picking up and object or firing a weapon.</li>
<li>Pictures of anything else you encounter in the game that seems appropriate for illustration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any content must be available under copyright terms no more restrictive than the version of the GPL that roguestar is distrubted under.  If you don't know what this means, just ask. <apply template="/hidden/links/contact-me"/></p>
